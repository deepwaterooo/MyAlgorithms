#+title: Algorithms Review for Job Interview
#+author: Jenny Huang

* 12/20/2014, Saturday
- Website (github), program highlight, and chinese input environment all good now;
- Will configure Linux Mint Java environment later, prefer emacs;
- 145/168 done before new season review, begin to work on these questions from today. 
- Just got 4 easiest done: *149/168*
  - min stack, 
  - excel sheet column title, 
  - compare version number, and 
  - intersection of two linked list,
* 12/21/2014, Sunday
- Only three got done today: *152/169*
  - maximum gap
  - fraction to recurring decimal
  - majority element
- Don't feel my mind is clear today at all, will look into job searing instead, hopefully tomorrow I can solve more problems, and slightly complicated ones;
* 12/22/2014, Monday
- So far got four done: *156/169*
  - sort list
  - merge k sorted list
  - trapping rain water
  - recovery binary search tree
- am going to work on the rest 6 tonight, so that hopefully tomorrow I would be able to work on the new 10 questions;
  - *word ladder II*: spent hours on this one, but got really sick with it! I should have solved my problems gradually, like solve the clone graph to understand graph first before touch this one, but I will get this one done later when I have clear mind. 
  - regular expression matching
  - divide two integers
  - clone graph
  - find peak element
* 12/23/2014, Tuesday
- Meet IPO staff this morning got coming semester plans clear at 8:30am in the morning;
- Will most probably meet some friend and have dinner together; changed to be *tomorrow noon*
- Hopefully by this morning's dirruption meeting staff, I could change back my regular schedule instead of 5am-13:30 day time sleeping, target for tonight fall asleep before 12:00am; fall asleep from 10:00-15:30, seems I will change my schedule back as expected tonight~!
- Will not work on Algorithms for today, but work on it hard tomorrow. I have my confidence that I can figure them out, and do great job summarize the questions during my Java round, no worries!
- so far Got 2 done: *158/169*
  - find peak element
  - maximal rectangle
* 12/24/2014, Wednesday
- 2:00(3:00am?)-11:00am, expect 2:00-9:00am schedule tonight;
- Don't know why old accound doesn't work any more, use new account; from *158/169* to *0/169* using *Java*
- Worked on the following questions: *1/169*
  - divide two integers, just got the Java environment ready
  - regular expression matching: *working on it!*, require understanding and summarizing
  - 知道猪是怎么死的吗？ *笨死了~~~*
* 12/25/2014, Thursday
- List a detailed plan of working on the algorithms; *Question Tags* according to the Website:
